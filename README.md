# Expense-Tracker

Keep a track of your own income and expenses and have a clear picture of where your money is going.

# Use of this project

The project aims to assist in tracking the inflow and outflow of money. In India, many individuals live on a fixed income and often struggle to meet their financial needs toward the end of the month. While low income can be a factor, this issue is frequently caused by poor money management skills. People may unknowingly overspend, which can lead to serious financial difficulties. A daily expense manager can help users monitor their spending habits, understand where their money goes, and gain better control over their finances. An expense tracker is an effective tool for managing expenses and bringing order to one's financial planning.
